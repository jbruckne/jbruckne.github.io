   I'm currently studying Computer Science at Purdue University with a focus in software engineering and systems programming. Outside of school, I enjoy working on Android Development. I have one app on the play store right now, [Last Pick](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=joebruckner.lastpick.release&hl=en), that has over 5,000 downloads.
